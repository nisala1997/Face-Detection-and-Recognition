# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent face detection and recognition system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system will detect faces in real-time, recognize individuals, and store their information for various applications such as security and access control.

## Features
Real-time Face Detection: Detects faces in live video streams using advanced deep learning techniques.
Face Recognition: Identifies and matches faces against a pre-stored database of known individuals.
Emotion Detection: Analyzes facial expressions to detect emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, etc.
Attendance System: Tracks attendance by recognizing faces of individuals entering the premises.
Data Storage: Saves detected faces and associated information for future recognition.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
Face Detection Algorithm: Haar Cascades, Dlib, or MTCNN
Face Recognition: FaceNet, OpenFace
Web Technologies: Flask for web application (if required)
Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing face data and associated information)
